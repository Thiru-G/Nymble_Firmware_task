## PC Code :
- Use [Pc_Code_simple.py](/Nymble/Pc_Code_simple.py) to use simple console based PC Code.
- Use [PC_Code_UI.py](/Nymble/PC_Code_UI.py) to use GUI based PC Code.

## Firmware : 
The Firmware is contructed using a simple logical approach. Since the requirement was to use CPP based firmware with structured and scalable features, this is one such solution. A Single Sketch solution is also available.
